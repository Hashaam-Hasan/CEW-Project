PROBLEM DEFINITION:
Construct an integrated environmental monitoring system in C, covering a range of fundamental concepts and practical applications. The project involves interacting with a free API that provides real-time environmental data. The system's core functionalities include data retrieval, processing, analysis, and reporting.
Attain hands on experience with contemporary functions of C.

Problem Outline:
Data Retrieval:
-Interact with a free API to retrieve real-time environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity). 
Data Processing and Analysis:
-Process the retrieved data using C programming concepts.
-Implement algorithms to analyze environmental data for anomalies or trends.

Data Storage:
-Store both raw and processed environmental data in files.
Reporting System:
-Develop a reporting system that generates reports based on the analyzed environmental data.
Automation and Integration:
-Create shell scripts to automate tasks such as data retrieval, processing, and report generation.
-Integrate shell scripts with the C program to enhance automation.
Optimization and Efficiency:
-Utilize pointers and dynamic memory allocation in the C program to optimize data manipulation and enhance
efficiency.
Real-time Alerts:
-Implement real-time alerts using Linux system calls to notify relevant personnel of critical environmental
readings.
Documentation and Code Organization:
-Develop comprehensive documentation for the monitoring system.
-Use header files to modularize the C code and enhance code readability.
